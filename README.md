# HospitalCostReports

Each year, Medicare-certified hospitals and providers are required to submit an annual cost report, called the CMS-2552-10 form, to a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC), who will then report the data to the Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) compiles these data and provides a dataset that aggregates at the hospital-level, and publishes them to data.cms.gov. This project will analyze the available data for five of the most recent years - FY 2014 to 2018 - to identify trends and determine which features are most associated with hospital profitability based on these reports.
